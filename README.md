# 🍽️ recipe-advisor-llm

**recipe-advisor-llm** is a machine learning-powered food recipe advisor that leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for intelligent recipe recommendations. The application uses a `MultinomialNB` (Multinomial Naive Bayes) model for text matching and is wrapped in a user-friendly interface built with [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/).

## 🧠 How It Works

- The core model is trained to match user inputs to relevant food recipes using Natural Language Processing techniques.
- It employs the Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm for efficient and effective text classification.
- The app is designed with Streamlit to provide an intuitive and interactive user experience.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python installed. You can install required packages using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run the Application

To launch the Streamlit app, run:

```bash
python -m streamlit run yemek-llm.py
```

This will open the web interface in your default browser.
